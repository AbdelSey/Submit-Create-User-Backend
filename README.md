# Submit-Create-User-Backend
A practice project to understand backend funtionality of getting data from a form and creating a new user from that data. This project involved MongoDB, React, Express, Mongoose, and Node. 

# User Interface
The main focus of this project was to gain a better understanding of the backend aspects of a website. Basically, the user interface isn't pretty. 

# Functionality 
Once the user submits the form with their name, last name, and age. The connection to the database is organized with Mongoose. The Schema will create the stucture that the data will follow and the model function will create data relationships to match the incoming data. That user will then be created in the MongoDB database and stored there.
